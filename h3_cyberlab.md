# Installing Linux on a virtual machine

The purpose with this task was to setup a secure environment for exploring basic hacking methods.

First I downloaded the following files:
- Virtual box from https://virtualbox.org/ 
- Linux Debian 13-Trixie installation from wwww.debian.org Download "Live Xfce" directly from [here](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-13.1.0-amd64-xfce.iso)

Then I installed virtualbox version 7.2.4 (amd64)
- I got a warning about a missing Python Core package, which can be installed later:
