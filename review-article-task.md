## What are the key areas being researched?

The purpose of the reviewed article was to develop a framework to help practitioners and researchers to improve cyber security implementation practices, based on an extensive systematic review.

In order do this, the authours reviewed past empirical research, published in peer-reviewed articles in the period from 2014 to 2023. Their aim was to explore the factors that influence the implementation of cyber security measures in organizations.

After the systematic selection process was completed, the authors based the research on 50 articles from a number of different countries, with around half of the articles published since 2022.

These were the research questions:
- RQ1. What factors influence cybersecurity implementation in organizations? 
- RQ2. How can these factors be addressed and developed as a framework to improve cybersecurity practices within organizations?

## What's widely agreed upon? 

The authors' research was essentially a very inclusive endeavour, as they sought to **explore** influencing factors based on past **empirical** research, and to develop a **new** framework (rather than building on an existing one). As such, the article does not really engage in much actual discussion per se, nor do they explicitely question or evaluate whether there is **agreement** in the past research, or contradictions. Instead, the cited studies generally bring up on additional and different specific influences, so all cited findings are **complementary**. 

The authors grouped the identified factors into four overall themes: Individual factors, Organizational factors, Technological factors, and the Governmental role. The individual and organizational factors was organized further into a number of subthemes. While technological and governmental factors probably could be developed further, this has seemingly not been the focus of the article

Below is a thematic overview of the factors they found to influence the implementation of cyber security measures:

- **Individual factors** – referring to employees’ personal factors that can impact their compliance
    - **Attitudes, behaviors and beliefs** related to cybersecurity influence the intention to comply
    - **Perception of power**:  **Self-efficacy** - an employees belief in his/her ability to comply, and his/her percieved **locus of control** - the employees belief that his/her actions have an impact.
    - **Awareness** of cybersecurity risks promote more compliance, increase emplyees' motivation to comply, helps to mitigate threats, and lead to the implementaition of more effective cyber security practices and risk management strategies
    - **Knowledge** in terms of having employees having enough knowledge about cyber security, as well as ensuring that employees know the company's information security policies and procedures.
- **Organizational factors** – referring to the organizational characteristics, norms, practices or actions that can influence the implementation of cyber security measures
    - **Organizational culture** that is supportive for cyber security, for example where employees have a sense of shared responsibility
    - **Training** as lack of training often is the root cause of poor compliance, whereas adequate training has a significant impact on all the individual factors, leading to improved compliance
    - **Cyber security policies** defining clear processes, strategies and responsibilities, that are established formally to ensure that employees understand their role.
    - **Leadership** refering to top management leading the way by example and by ensuring support for the development of cyber security capabilities.
    - **Security monitoring team** - a formal team dedicated to cyber security, implementing close monitoring and security metrics, maintaining clear and open communication channels, and effective crises management.
- **Technological factors** – referring to factors like a mature IT infrastructure or technological expansion or operational control.
- **Governmental role** – referring to the high influence of governments' regulatory pressure on companies implementing cyber security measures.


While it is clear that technological factors naturally could be developed further, the authors delved deeper into the personal and organizational factors
